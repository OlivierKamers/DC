How to compile BFL (adapted from http://people.mech.kuleuven.be/~tdelaet/bfl_doc/installation_guide/)
Download bfl code:
svn co http://svn.mech.kuleuven.be/repos/orocos/trunk/bfl

Patch the file bfl/src/wrappers/rng/rng.cpp using https://www.fmtc.be/bugzilla/orocos/attachment.cgi?id=233

In alternative just remove "static" from the following line in bfl/src/wrappers/rng/rng.cpp:
from
static boost::mt19937 Boost_Rng; // Source of randomness
to
boost::mt19937 Boost_Rng; // Source of randomness

Run ccmake in bfl/build directory:

ccmake ..

type 'c' to configure, and 'e' to exit the page that shows the configure output

make sure to use RNG_LIB and MATRIX_LIB boost, CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=release for example:                                                                                                                
CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE                *Release                                                                                                                                    
MATRIX_LIB                      *boost                                                                                                                                     
RNG_LIB                         *boost              

Now repeat the 'c' configure and 'e' exit cycle, until you get no more errors. When this is the case, you'll have the 'g' generate option available. Press 'g' to generate the makefiles, and then quit cmake with 'q' quit. 

Now all configuration is done, and you can build BFL:

make

To check the functionality of BFL, use

make check

To install BFL use

sudo make install
